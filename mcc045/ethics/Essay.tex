\section{Introduciton}
Define free software. We are concerend about your freedom. Price is a practical detail (write about this). state the four freedoms. Explain them. either you controll the program and you can change it to do what you need. else the program controlls you and you must change what you do/need to fit the program. the prorpietary company that created the program therefor controlls you!

Define proprietary software. why is it bad? all proprietary software is either known malware or potential malware. you don't controll the software so it must controll you. you can not make it do what you need. you can never know what it REALLY does since you can not see the source code.

There are two standpoints. the ethical and the practical.

the ethical: your freedom to have control over your computing. you must control the program or it will controll

the practical: you don't own the software so anything you create with it can never be trulu yours. your company depend on the creator of the software. what happens when the proprietary developer goes out of buissness? what happens if they stop supporting your software? how will you access your previous work?

for engineers? by using

solution? them program itself should not be the product. your should sell your service (support, solutions tailored today the customer).
