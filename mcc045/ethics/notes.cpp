Notes
----- Free software in enginering

- Free as in freedom. (show the four freedoms if possible)

- Open source-directory focus on *practical benefits*

- Proprietary software is everything else. (that don't have the four freedoms)

--- Why you should care

- Either the users control the program or the program controls the user.

- Who controls the program controls the users. Proprietary software is malware

- Data collection can be profitable and proprietary developers know this.

- Free software is not guaranteed not to be malware.

- We can check the source code to make sure it is not malware.

- Analogy with public contracts.

--- In engineering

- Have you read the EULA of a proprietary program?

- You can not know what a proprietary program does. What you see may not be what you get.

- You do not own the software, only the right to use it.

- What will you do if you don't have the license?
- What if the company does not exist?
- What if they abandon the file format.

- You must not publish the code, called private software.

--- Solution

- The software is not the product. you sell a service.

- Every problem is different -- requires different solution.

- Think of how e.g. lawyers make money.
